Syd's Box
=========
SydBox is a [ptrace](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html) & [seccomp](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html) based sandbox for modern [Linux](https://kernel.org) machines to sandbox unwanted process access to filesystem and network resources.

SydBox uses autotools. To build, simply do:

```
$ ./configure --enable-seccomp
$ make -j
$ make -j check
$ sudo make install
```

To use SydBox you need a recent [Linux](https://kernel.org) kernel, preferably 3.5
or newer which has [secure computing mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp)
facility. Make sure you build SydBox with **--enable-seccomp**

In addition, it is advised that you enable the kernel option
`CONFIG_CROSS_MEMORY_ATTACH=y`.

**NOTE:** Pandora is in its early stages of development. To be able to use pandora
you should clone SydBox from [git](https://git.exherbo.org/git/sydbox-1.git).

Pandora
=======
Pandora's Box: A helper for SydBox, a ptrace & seccomp based sandbox to make sandboxing practical.
This makes it easy for the end user to use secure computing for practical purposes.

Simple Example:
```
# Step 1: Inspect and gather data about the given process.
# In this case, we're going to try with
# Firefox, https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/new/
$ pandora profile firefox
# browse using firefox for a while, let pandora gather data.
# the browser is running under a tracer so it'll run noticably slower.
# use --bin /path/to/sydbox, if sydbox is not in PATH
# use --output firefox.syd-1 to specify an alternative output path for profile.
$ $EDITOR out.syd-1
# Inspect what the browser has been doing.
# Enable, disable additional options or turn paths into wildcards such as
# /home/*** to allow home and everything beyond /home
# the usual glob characters, ?, * are supported.
# Check sydbox manual page to learn more on how pattern matching works.
# Enable, disable additional network addresses unless you're using a SOCKS5 proxy
# which does remote DNS lookups, e.g:
#
# whitelist/network/connect+inet:127.0.0.1@9050
#
# for Tor, https://www.torproject.org/
# Check sydbox manual page to learn more on how address matching works.
#
$ pandora box -c out.syd-1 firefox
# Run the browser under secure computing with full protection.
# Check sydbox manual page for a list of system call protections.
# Check the console for possible access violations over time.
# Edit the profile file as necessary and update restrictions.
#
# Share your profile with other people and help others use secure computing!
#
```
