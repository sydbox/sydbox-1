[92mCalm

Gravity is the source of lightness,
Calm, the master of haste.
A lone traveller will journey all day, watching over his
belongings;
Only safe in his own bed may he lose them in sleep.
So the captain of a great vessel should not act lightly or hastily.
Acting lightly, he loses sight of the world,
Acting hastily, he loses control of himself.
The captain can not treat his great ship as a small boat;
Rather than glitter like jade
He must stand like stone.
