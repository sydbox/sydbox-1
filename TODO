# Sydbox

- Do not call ptrace() from dump.c under any circumstances.
- Avoid unnecessary printf usage in dump.c
- Finish the rework on tests
- SIGUSR2 dumps sydcore
- Use a simpler hashtable instead of using uthash everywhere.
- provide a list of system calls to whitelist/blacklist on startup to feed
  to seccomp-bpf filters. A whitelisted system call will be allowed and will
  further be subject to sandbox restrictions. A blacklisted system call will
  be denied with ENOSYS directly by seccomp. The user may input a list of
  regular expressions to match system calls for restrictions.
- use allowlist/denylist rather than whitelist/blacklist list in syd-2 profiles
- rename the master branch to main
- no ptrace() attach should happen if all of
  core/sandbox/{read,write,exec,network}:bpf

# Pandora

- box should learn to drop privileges to a different user and group.
- box should learn to change to a different directory such as /var/empty.
- box should learn to chroot.
- box should learn to use namespaces.
- box profile should learn to save a checksum of the binary in the profile.
  (requires PATH traversal?)
- box profile should learn to cryptographically sign the header of the profile
- box profile should learn to upload out.syd-1 to a public location.
- box profile should learn to check the checksum of a binary and download a
  profile from a public location.
- box profile should be able to cryptographically verify the signature in the
  header of a profile downloaded from a public location.
- box should learn to read sydbox magic configuration via TOML format
- generate docs from pandora --help output for docs.rs if it's possible
- add benchmarks with criterion to benchmark certain box invocations.
